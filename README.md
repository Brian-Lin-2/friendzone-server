# Friendzone Server

This is the backend for the friendzone app: https://github.com/Brian-Lin-2/friendzone-client

## Features
  * User data is stored on the MongoDB database.
  * CRUD operations for users and messages.
  * Implementation of socket.io to set up web socketse for real-time chat.
  * User authentication using jwt-passport and tokens.

## Motivation
I wanted practice with creating a RESTFUL API that can handle and process requests from the client and return results.
